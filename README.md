# Arc-Encrypt
A Fun android app made to encrypt and decrypt messages

This app uses key combinations to encrypt the messages. It also gives you the option to decrypted the encrypted message if you know the key.
The key combinations are 500+ so the chances that someone else can guess the key you and your friend decided to use are very low.

It was a very fun project i got the idea from a clients work, i took it many steps further just for fun.

The icons used for this app are not mine i do not own them. the credit for that goes to their creator
